#RESEARCH REQS

##Research Mechanics
The player should never known when a "fundamental" research will be available. So there is 2 type of research :

- Fundamental : discover new mechanices, invent new systems
- Practical : Improve existing technologies

##FTL Mechanics
In the game, there is not only one way to do interstellar travel. The research will lean toward one in particular and try to stick with it.
However, the player can choose to invest in new FTL technologies if he wishes to but it should not be easy to obtain.

Some FTL technologies we can think of :

- Warp Drives : Uses some kind of Alcubierre drive to move a ship through space-time
- Hyperdrives : Fastest way of travel, but no communication with the vessel available and subject to gravity (no hyperdrive near a planet). The vessel travel through a subspace tunnel
- Jump Drives : Instant jumps through space, like wormholes. Need to discover jump points between star systems. Cannot jump anywhere he want
- Catapult :  A station with a catapult module that propulse a ship through space. Cannot come back if does-not have another catapult. Poorly precise unless another catapult at destination + required tech
