#PEOPLE REQS

##REQ01 - Basics
People run an empire. The two kind of people in an empire are :

- Civilians : Administrators for colonies and companies, civil researchers for research centers...
- Military : Naval or ground officers

Military officers with research skills can be affected to research centers and be science officers on starships.
However, civilians cannot serve on a starship

###REQ01-1 - Civilian Administrators
They can administrate a colony or a sector. Their administration rating rule the size of the colony/sector they can administrate.
They have a list of modifiers affecting the colony and all the colonies in the sector where they rule

###REQ01-2 - Civilian Researchers
Researchers have one or more specialities and a skill level for each specialty. They also have a base reseach skill level.
If a researcher works on a project in one of his specialties, he add his base level and his specialty level. If he does not work
on a project in one of his specialties, he only add his base research. So you can have very good general scientists, and poor general scientist
but very good specialty ones.

####REQ01-2-1 - Military Researchers
Naval and ground officers can have research bonuses and only one specialty. The mechanic is the same as for civilian researchers (but they are
limited to one specialty and cannot obtain another). They can serve on starships as science officers

##REQ02 - Military Ranking
Military officers follow a chain of command.

##REQ03 - Military Academy
A military academy is required to train people for the empire.

###REQ03-01 Training

A military academy train up to X officers and Y crewmans per year. The entire production of people become available on a fixed date every
years : the date they graduate. The player can choose how many years the students have to train before graduating and the proportion between
X and Y. The player can also choose the difficulty of the training, so he can make a choice between quality and quantity.

###REQ03-02 Installations
A military academy can be expanded by adding more courses available. A list of courses that can be added :

- Starship operations : train officers for starship command positions
- Starfighter piloting : train officers to become fighter pilots
- Science course : train officers to become science officers
- etc.

The player can choose the proportion of each course in the academy standard training. Each course will give a chance for the officer to 
develop the skills associated with the course. So if 50% of the course is starfighter piloting, 50% of the officers produced will have a 
good chance to be good pilots.

###REQ03-03 - Teaching
Skilled officers or retired officers can be assigned to teach in the academy. The skills of the teacher associated to the course he is affected to
will affect the quality of the officers produced.

##REQ04 - Teams
Teams are group of people performing missions and tasks together.
Teams can only perform actions at their locations, unless they are assigned to a starship. Giving a mission to a team will ask the player if he wishes
to stop the current orders of the ship associated with it to carry the mission. Missions will come in variety such as diplomacy, espionnage, 
sabotage, xenology, etc.
Teams affected to a starship will occupy spare berths available. If no available, the team cannot be assigned to the starship.
